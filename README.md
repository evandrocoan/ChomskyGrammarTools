## Installation/running

1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/evandrocoan/ContextFreeGrammars`
1. Open a command line on the projects main folder: `cd ContextFreeGrammars`
1. Install its dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. And run it with `python source/main.py`


## I - Definition:

An application,
with graphical interface to manipulate CFG,
involving the following operations:
1. Edit CFG's verbatim;
2. Check whether L (G) is empty, finite or infinite;
3. Transform a CFG into Proper CFG,
   providing: Intermediate grammars, Nf, Vi, Ne and Na;
4. Calculate First (A),
   Follow (A) and First-NT (A) (defined as the set of symbols of Vn that can start sequences derived from A) for all A âˆˆ Vn;
5. Check if G is factored or if it is factored in n steps;
6. Check whether or not G has Left Recursion - identifying the recursive non-terminals
   on the left and the type of recursions (direct and / or indirect) and,
   if it has left recursions,
   eliminate recursions.

## II - Observations:
1. Represent the CFG in a textual way, following the pattern of the examples below:

   **a)**
   ```
   E -> E + T | E-T | T
   T -> T * F | T / F | F
   F -> (E) | id
   ```

   **b)**
   ```
    E -> T E1
   E1 -> + T E1 | &
    T -> F T1
   T1 -> * F T1 | &
    F -> (E) | id
   ```
2. Leave a blank space between the symbols on the right.
3. Represent non-terminals by capital letter (followed by 0 or + digits).
4. Represent terminals with one or more contiguous characters (any characters,
   except uppercase letters).
5. Use & to represent epsilon.
6. Present the intermediate results obtained.
